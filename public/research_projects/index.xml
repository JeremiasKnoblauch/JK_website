      <description>Bayesian On-line Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) is a discrete-time inference framework introduced in the statistics and machine learning community independently by Fearnhead &amp;amp; Liu (2007) and Adams &amp;amp; MacKay (2007). Taken together, both papers have generated in excess of 500 citations and inspired more research in this area. The method is popular because it is efficient and runs in constant time per observation processed. Me and my collaborators are working on extending the inference paradigm in several ways:</description>
