## About me
I am a postgraduate researcher working at the boundary of computer science and statistics within the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme (OxWaSP). I am jointly supervised by [Theodoros Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/theo_damoulas/ "Theodoros Damoulas' Warwick page") and [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/ "Chenlei Leng's Warwick page"). 
My interests are focused on scalable spatio-temporal inference procedures for data generating mechanisms in high dimensions that are ill-behaved or difficult to describe. This encompasses modelling and inference for non-stationary data streams whose behaviours change across time as well as space.
My research is part of the [Clean Air London project at the Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/clean-air-london/ "Clean Air London ATI project description") to support London's Major's office with data-driven policy.
More information can be found in my (outdated) [CV](/docs/CV.pdf).
