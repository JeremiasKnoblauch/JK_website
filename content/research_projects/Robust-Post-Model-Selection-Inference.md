summary = "Research on the transfer of Post Selection Inference (PoSI) due to Berk et al. (2014) into a time series setting that does not require the Data Generating Mechanism and the model to coincide. This is work I did as my master thesis under the supervision of [Stephan Smeekes](http://researchers-sbe.unimaas.nl/stephansmeekes/)."

This work is not yet published, but Stephan and I are hoping to resume our work on it soon. If you have a strong interest in this subject, do get in touch with me and I will happily share my thesis work with you.
